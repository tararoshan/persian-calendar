# Persian Calendar
Time estimate: 50hr

Time spent *so far*: 1h 50m

## Getting started
From the PersianCalendar directory, first install the needed packages (`npm i`)
and then run `npm start`. Install the Expo Go app and scan the QR code in the
console to load the app on your phone (make sure it's connected to the same WiFi
as your local machine).

## Progress and pitfalls
6/13/23: React Native Calendars seems like it only supports the Gregorian-style
calendars, but I need to change the number of days in each month. Using Chat GPT
to give suggestions & I'll look at the code before scrapping the idea.
- update: going to scrap this for a while and choose an easier idea
